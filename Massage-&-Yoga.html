        <h2>Deep Tissue Massage</h2>
        <p>
          Deep tissue massage centers on realigning the deeper layers of
          connective and muscle tissue. It aims to release the chronic patterns
          of tension in the body through slow strokes and deep finger pressure
          on the tense areas, either following or going across the fiber’s of
          the muscles, tendons and fascia. It is particularly helpful for
          continually tight and contracted areas such as stiff necks, low back
          tightness, and sore shoulders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deep tissue massage is much more than just a “hard massage.” In
          contrast to only relaxing muscles, the specific lengthening of fascia,
          muscles and tendons offers many benefits such as increased joint
          movement, quicker injury recovery, better posture, as well as feelings
          of well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deep tissue massage is often used to treat chronic pain, limited
          mobility, recovery from injuries (e.g. whiplash, falls, and sports
          injury), repetitive strain injury (carpal tunnel syndrome), postural
          problems, osteoarthritis pain, muscle tension or spasm.

        <h2>Sports Massage</h2>
        <p>
          Sports massage can be beneficial for athletes, active people or
          anybody with tension. Often has a lot of overlap with deep tissue
          massage, depending on what you need, while also incorporating more
          techniques such as kneading, compressions & cirular friction to help
          break down adhesions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Regular sports massage can help increase flexibility, realign muscle
          fibres, and restore muscle length, shape and strength. It can also be
          used to aid training to reduce fatigue, injury and delayed onset
          muscle soreness, allowing you to perform at your best.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tailor each massage to the individual, so whether you like your
          massage strong and deep or soft and gentle I am here to serve you. I
          use different techniques for different bodies, as every body is
          different and reacts differently.

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row column-reverse">
      <div class="column">
        <h2>Relaxing massage</h2>
        <p>
          This is normally a whole body therapeutic massage designed to relax
          your muscles and joints, stimulate blood flow and calm your nervous
          system. You can of course still request specific area that you would
          rather focus more attention on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using long rhythmic strokes with pressure that is gentle, moderate or
          deep according to your preference. Unwind to peaceful music and
          relaxing scents.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will pay attention to your body as a whole, and will still work on
          any areas that are holding more tension, the difference being that
          this will be much more gentle than a deep tissue massage, so you can
          relax deeply. If the pressure ever gets too much, just let me know so
          I can ease off.

        <h2>Private yoga session</h2>
        <p>
          Are you trying to find more movement and/or mobility in your life?
        </p>
        <p>I've been practicing yoga since 2010, & teaching since 2016.</p>
        <p>
          Over that time I have learnt from many other teachers and movement
          experts. I've worked with the super flexible and inflexible! With
          people working on arm balances, and beginners just working on the
          basics.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you may have noticed by now I am passionate about functional
          movement. This flows into my yoga style too. The first thing we'll do
          when you come to practice yoga with me is figure out what you can do
          easily, and what you find more challenging, I want to know what your
          lifestyle is like, what' your movement practice is like?What are your
          goals? Then we will combine breathing techniques and yoga poses to
          help you get stronger and more mobile.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on what your needs and comfort levels are, the practice may
          be slow and methodical, flowy, loosy goosy, strong & powerful,
          meditative, fast-paced, zen & relaxing, or a combination of all these
          styles. Within yoga there are some general alignment rules to keep you
          safe from injury - I pay close attention to these rules, buut
          sometimes rules are made to be broken, once you have a good
          foundational understanding of the rules in your body then we can play
          more and more with how to break the rules in healthy ways!
        </p>
        <p>
          The benefits of private yoga are that you have the freedom to ask
          questions, there's nobody else in the room to worry about, you have
          more agency over what kind of practice you would like, together we can
          create a practice that moves you out of your normal patterns, a
          practice that pushes you and makes you sweat, or a practice that
          brings you that much needed relaxation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're practicing with me through winter or in the summer I
          will get this room to the perfect temperature for you, with my dual
          heaters for warmth, and windows for fresh air!

        <h2>Group yoga classes</h2>
        <p>
          I have not been teaching many group yoga classes, as I can’t quite fit
          them in amongst massages, family life & everyone elses timetables -
          but I hope to get these back up and running in the summer. They will
          be BYO mat as I don't have enough mats for a group.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can however guide private group yoga classes in the styles Vinyasa,
          Gentle, Beginners, Hot yoga (26 & 2) or Yin yoga. And can fit a class
          of 4 comfortably into the studio, 6 will work too, or 8 packed in like
          sardines.
