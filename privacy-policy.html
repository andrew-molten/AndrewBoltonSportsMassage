        <strong
          >At Andrew Bolton Sports Massage we take privacy seriously and this
          page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and
          disclosure of personal information.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re committed to protecting the privacy of all individuals that
        provide personal information to us, including the data recorded by
        customers when you book an appointment.
      </p>
      <p>
        This privacy policy explains how we collect, protect, use and share
        personal information. We may review and change this policy from time to
        time. When we do, we'll update this version located at
        https://www.andrewboltonsportsmassage.com/privacy-policy
      </p>
      <h4 style="color: #145cad">Personal information we collect</h2>
        <p>We collect personal data in a couple of different ways—directly and
        indirectly.</p>

        <p><strong>Personal information we collect directly from you</strong></p>

        <p>
        We directly collect Personal Information if you book an appointment
        online and if you send an enquiry to us from our website, or get in
        touch with us by chat, email, or phone.</p>
        
        <p>We may also collect some
        personal information if you engage with us through social media. This
        information can include and is not limited to your name, gender, date of
        birth, country of birth, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses.</p>

        <p>We do not directly collect any special categories of personal data about
        you. This includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or
        philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions,
        trade union membership, and genetic and biometric data. Nor do we
        collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.</p>

        <p><strong>Personal information we collect indirectly</strong></p>

        <p>Very rarely we indirectly collect personal information when someone is
        referred to our practice. A possible scenario would be when a healthcare
        professional refers a patient to our office and sends personal
        information about a patient.</p> 
        <p>This information can include and is not
        limited to names, genders, dates of birth, countries of birth,
        residential addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, a person’s
        emergency contacts, health insurance numbers, ACC claim details, health
        history, health status and patient treatment notes and records.</p>
        <p>In
        addition, in order to improve our services, we use data that can be
        retrieved from cookies, and other technology whose purpose is gathering
        data about website use. This data may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Browser and hardware data, such as IP address, type of device,
          operating system, browser type, screen resolution, language, device
          make and model, as well as the versions of the above mentioned
          services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cookie and tracking technology data, which would include pages
          visited, time spent on pages, language preferences, and other
          anonymous traffic data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 style="color: #145cad">How this information is used</h4>
      <p>
        In general, personal information we collect is used by us to inform our
        decision making in how to best look after the client. The personal
        information we collect about our own clients may also be used for
        billing, identification, authentication, and for contacting them if we
        need to.</p>

        line.</p>

        with any other entity unless the person it relates to has requested that
        it is shared.</p>
        <p>We may use other data for a range of different purposes,
        provided we comply with applicable law and our contractual commitments,
        such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To deliver customer service and assist you with any inquiries you may
          have.
        </li>
        <li>
          To analyse trends, administer or optimise our service, monitor usage
          or traffic patterns and gather demographic information about our user
          base as a whole.
        </li>
        <li>
          To control unauthorised use or abuse of our database—or otherwise

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 style="color: #145cad">How information is disclosed</h4>
      <p>
        Except as described in this Privacy Policy, Andrew Bolton Sports Massage
        will not share, sell, or rent personal information with anyone without
        your permission or unless ordered by a court of law. We work with
        third-party services in New Zealand and Australia, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ‘Cliniko’ our practice management software, located in Australia
        </li>
        <li>‘Hnry’, our tax agent, located in New Zealand</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        that we allow access to personal information, and may use it on our
        behalf strictly for the purposes for which they are engaged. We minimise
        the amount of personal data that is utilised by these services, and we
        have ensured that these services process your data in accordance with
        the appropriate regulations. We are not responsible for the privacy
        policies and practices of these third-party services.</p>
        <p>We may forward
        personal information and health records to another health professional
        if requested with consent.</p>
        <p>In rare circumstances, we may be obliged to
        disclose personal information if disclosure is required to comply with
        the law, if we believe it is necessary to protect our rights, or if the
        ownership and assets of Andrew Bolton Sports Massage were to be
        transferred to another party.
      </p>
      <h4 style="color: #145cad">The security of your Personal Information</h4>
      <p>
        We take security seriously, and so do our third party services. Data is
        encrypted, stored in state-of-the-art facilities, access is restricted
        to those who have a need to know, and the technology to maintain
        security is regularly reviewed.</p>
        <p>In the event that there is a breach and
        your Personal Information that we have collected directly is at risk,
        you will be notified within 96 hours of discovering the breach. You will
        be informed of what information is at risk, steps that we have taken to
        ensure your safety, and what action we are taking or have taken to
        rectify the breach.</p>
        <p><strong>Access, correct or delete personal information about
        you</strong></p>
        <p>You can request access to the personal information you have provided
        to us, via email to andrew@andrewboltonsportsmassage.com.</p>
        <p>If you think
        there’s a problem with the personal information we hold about you, you
        can request a correction. This enables you to have any incomplete or
        inaccurate data we hold about you corrected.</p>
        <p>If you want to request
        erasure of your personal information, we'll take all reasonable steps to
        do so unless we are required to keep it for legal reasons, which will be
        notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
      </p>
