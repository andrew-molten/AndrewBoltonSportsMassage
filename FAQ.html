        <h3>Should I come if I have an injury?</h3>
        <p>
          Massage can be great for healing injuries, reducing stiffness and
          restoring movement. If you have just been injured it’s recommended
          that you spend the first 72 hours in R-I-C-E mode (resting, icing,
          compressing & elevating the injury) to minimize inflammation and pain.
          Generally after the 72 hour mark the injury will start to enter the
          repair phase which is a good stage to start massage therapy.
        </p>
        <h3>What happens during the massage?</h3>
        <p>
          Before the massage we will discuss the areas to be massaged, and check
          for any contra-indications. Then I go behind the curtain so that you
          can get changed and jump on the table under the towel. I massage with
          oil, any areas that are not being treated at the time will be covered
          by the towel. You’re welcome to talk during the treatment, or if you
          just prefer to relax and breathe that’s fine too and may even help to
          make the massage more effective. Every treatment is different, but the
          normal process is to warm up the area I am working on, and then work
          progressively deeper, sometimes using friction techniques, long slow
          strokes, and compressions where I target a really tight spot while you
          breathe deeply.

        <h3>I’m nervous about pain, will it hurt?</h3>
        <p>
          You don't need to worry about pain, I understand that every persons
          pain tolerance and preference is different so I always adjust my
          pressure for each person and what you're comfortable with. Sometimes
          in massage we work with pain and the breath to help relax your muscles
          and relieve tensions. I will often ask if the pressure is okay, and at
          any time during the massage you can ask for more or less pressure.
        </p>
        <h3>How often should I get massage?</h3>

        <p>
          It varies from person to person, and depends on the goal of
          treatments. For chronic pain I may recommend weekly massages at first,
          while some other cases you may just need a one off massage. I
          personally believe in getting regular massages to massage the tensions
          and stresses away before they manifest as pain or dysfunction. I also
          believe in looking after yourself with other practices which will mean
          that you don't need as many massages i.e. strength training, stability
          & cardiovascular training, breathwork, self massage, yin yoga,
          non-sleep-deep-rest & stress management strategies for the challenges
          in your life.

        <h3>
          Do you have any recommendations for getting the most out of the
          massage?
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Breathe</strong> - I love a chat, and you might too! But don't
          feel like you have to talk to me - my job is to work out your aches
          and pains. So the sooner you can drop out of talking and into the
          breath the better. I recommend deep slow breathing as much as possible
          - especially if an area is painful - as you exhale, let your whole
          body relax into the table as much as possible, especially the area
          that I'm working on. By working with the breath like this you are
          signalling to your nervous system that you are safe which promotes
          relaxation letting go of the tensions that you have come to be
          relieved of.
        </p>
        <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
        <p>
          Wear something you feel comfortable in. Generally I massage with oil
          on your skin for the best results. I will leave the room so that you
          can get changed into what you're comfortable in (usually underwear)
          and then you lay on the table underneath a towel which is used to
          preserve your modesty and cover any areas that aren’t being worked on
          throughout the massage.

      <div class="column">
        <h3>How long should I book for?</h3>
        <p>
          I highly recommend at least an hour because, even if you only have a
          small area that you are concerned about, your body will be holding
          tensions in other areas that will most likely benefit from being
          released too.<br />
          The other great benefit is that because of our fast paced lives it can
          take a little while to fully relax into the massage, so sometimes
          during a 45 minutes you might just be getting to that fully relaxed
          place on the table and then your massage is over.<br />
          I have stopped doing 30 minute massages because it just never feels
          like I can do enough in that time to really help. I'm still happy to
          do 45 minute massages. I just think the longer you can come for, the
          better you will feel when we're finished! That said, for many people I
          also believe that 1 hour massages more regularly will probably help
          your body more than a 2 hour massage irregularly.
