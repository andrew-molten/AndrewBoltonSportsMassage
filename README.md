# Andrew Bolton Sports Massage Website

www.andrewboltonsportsmassage.com

A Website for my Massage business, to inform clients who I am, what to expect, and make it easy to book appointments.

## Journey
When I opened for business, I used squarespace to get started, then after learning some basic HTML, CSS & JS, this became my first solo project, to build something customizable for me, and save some $$.

I was super proud to figure out how to build the image slider on the homepage myself, and also make it responsive for different screen sizes.
