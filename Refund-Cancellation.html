      <h4>Refunds</h4>
      <p>
        If you need to cancel your appointment, and can do it at least 24 hours
        before the massage (If you have already paid). Then we can reschedule
        your appointment, or a refund can be provided the same way that you
        paid.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you paid online (via stripe/card), your refund may be minus the
        stripe fee, as stripe do not refund their fees. Their fees can be found
        <a id="classicLink" href="https://stripe.com/en-nz/pricing">here.</a>
      </p>
      <h4>24 hours notice</h4>
      <p>
        In most cases you should be able to give me 24 hours notice. The more
        notice the better and it is greatly appreciated as it makes it easier to
        book other people in!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are sick or have an emergency just let me know as soon as
        possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if you have to cancel within 24 hours, and you just didnâ€™t try to
        give me adequate notice then unfortunately I will have to charge you the
        smaller amount of: $50 or 50% of the appointment price.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a limited number of appointment times available each week, which
        normally fill up, but last minute cancellations really hurt, when a
        space that would normally have been booked, canâ€™t be filled at such
        short notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I manage to fill your appointment slot, then I wonâ€™t charge you the
        cancellation fee. ðŸ™‚
      </p>
      <h4>No-shows</h4>
      <p>
        Unfortunately I will have to charge you the smaller amount of: $50 or
        50% of the appointment price.
      </p>
      <p>
        No-shows hurt the most, because I canâ€™t fill the appointment, and
        because I invest my precious time preparing for someone to arrive so
        that I can give them the best massage, but I end up twiddling my thumbs.
      </p>
      <h4>Late to your appointment</h4>
      <p>
        If you are late to your appointment then you will still be charged the
        price of the appointment you booked and the appointment will finish at
        its scheduled finish time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please double check your appointment time and the traffic, so you can
        make it here on time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Often if youâ€™re 5 mins late then I can make that 5 mins up at the other
        end. But normally I canâ€™t make up any more time than that, and
        definitely canâ€™t make any promises.
      </p>
      <h4>If I cancel</h4>
      <p>
        If I have to cancel because I am sick or have an emergency, then we can
        reschedule if that works for you, otherwise I will fully refund any
        amount you have already paid.
      </p>
      <h4>Contact</h4>
      <p>
        The best way to contact me is email at:
        andrew@andrewboltonsportsmassage.com let me know your name and
        situation. Or you can also text me on 02041780923. Sometimes I can take
        a call, but I am often busy massaging.
