        <h3>Breathing</h3>
        <p class="under-heading">
          We all do it, most people probably even know that they “should breathe
          deeper”, but thinking you should do something and doing it are two
          very different things. There are entire books and courses dedicated to
          the breath, so here I just want to break down some of the basics in
          the hopes that I can inspire you to breathe better.
        </p>
        <h3>What does a healthy breath look like anyway?</h3>
        <p class="under-heading">
          Experts suggest that healthy breathing is
          <strong>slow, spacious, nasal breathing. Spacious</strong> meaning
          that belly, chest & ribs expand as you inhale. <strong>Slow</strong> -
          ideally 5 breaths per minute at rest, which works out at about 5.5
          second inhales and exhales. & <strong>through your nose</strong> if
          possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Breathing</strong> slowly because both slower inhaling and
          exhaling develops CO2 tolerance and increases blood flow to the brain,
          while also helping the lungs absorb more oxygen from the air we suck
          in. We also know that the heart beats faster on an inhale, and slower
          on an exhale, so extending the exhale tends to help bring us into a
          more relaxed state
        </p>
        <So>
          <strong>Through the nose</strong> because your nasal cavities can
          filter out toxins, humidify and warm the air coming in, and enhance
          your circulation. While mouth breathing can cause musculoskeletal
          issues. Mouth breathers can tend to jut their heads forward,
          increasing the weight on the spine. Mouth breathing can also cause
          more stiffness in the jaw and neck because when you inhale through the
          mouth you default to using the musculature in the upper chest and neck
          to inflate the lungs rather than the diaphragm. This is also why
          <strong>a healthy breath is deep and spacious</strong> because you
          will be breathing using the muscles that were designed to breathe for
          you. </p><p>So breathe through the nose if you can, even while exercising,
          the efficiiency that you lose in the short term while breathing
          through your nose as you run, you will gain back in the long term.
        </p>
        <h3>My favourite breathing hacks</h3>
        <p class="under-heading">
          <strong>Organise your body for the breath.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="under-heading">
          There's an easy experiment to do here - set yourself up by slouching
          in a chair, shoulders rounded forward, and neck rounded. Now try to
          take a deep breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          You probably found it pretty uncomfortable right? Now re-organise
          yourself into whatever shape you think you’ll be able to take a deeper
          breath, and try taking a deep breath again. How does it feel? Chances
          are that was a whole lot easier and felt better? The great upside of
          this exercise is that by re-organising yourself for better breath you
          actually just naturally fix your posture to be stronger and healthier,
          but it’s a much easier cue than “pelvis neutral, spine long, chest
          broad, shoulders back etc.”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just think “how could I re-organise for breath here?” & you can apply
          that to any position you’re in, whether it’s at a desk, walking,
          cycling, chores, lifting. Then you can use poor posture or any of this
          actions as triggers to re-organise & breathe better.
        </p>
        <p class=""><strong>Notice when your holding your breath</strong></p>
        <p class="under-heading">
          You have probably noticed that you hold your breath to do difficult
          tasks sometimes right? We don’t even think about it, it happens
          automatically, because a great amount of strength and stability comes
          from a breath hold, which helps especially with lifting, holding or
          exerting forces on things. But it doesn’t really help when breath
          holding becomes a pattern to think through something difficult, or
          when you have to hold things for longer than you can hold your breath.
          If your nervous system has to choose between breathing to survive, and
          holding your baby (human, furry, or otherwise), it’s going to choose
          the breath!
        </p>
        <p>
          So if you’ve held your breath, then it will down-regulate your
          strength to get you to breathe. However if you are able to own the
          position from the start and continue breathing normally and deeply
          then you probably have the strength required anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          So if you can just try your best to notice when you hold your breath
          and use that as a trigger to re-organise your body for breath, then I
          believe you will feel much stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
          P.s. This breath holding sometimes happens at the silliest of times,
          like just now when I was slipping into my sandals, or when anything
          involves balance.
        </p>
        <h3>Other thoughts on the breath</h3>
        <p>
          It can be quite hard to access full deep breaths throughout the day,
          if you haven't done anything yet that forces you to spend some time
          doing some strong breathing. However if you've already done some
          strong breathing early on in the day, then deep strong breathing
          throughout the day will become much more natural for you. 
        </p>
        <ul>So here are
          a couple of ideas to get into the breath first thing in the day:
          <li>Exercise - no matter what kind of exercise it is, and spend at least some portion of your training focussed on your breath.</li>
          <li>Yoga - breathing is core to the yoga practice, so you will find connection to your breath there.</li>
          <li>Breathwork - there is a vast world of breathwork practitioners, you could start with Wim Hof on youtube, & explore other breathwork practitioners there, or maybe you will respond better to a session guided by a breathwork practitioner in real time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Go deeper</h3>
        <ul>As I said there is so much to explore in the world of breath, this was just a taster, if you want to go deeper these are some resources I can highly recommend:
